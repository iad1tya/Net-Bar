Net Bar Installation Guide
==========================

Thank you for downloading Net Bar!

Installation Steps:
1. Drag "NetBar.app" to the "Applications" folder alias in this window.
2. Launch Net Bar from your Applications folder.

Troubleshooting "App is damaged" or "Cannot be opened":
------------------------------------------------------
Because this app is open-source and not signed with a paid Apple Developer Account ($99/year), macOS Gatekeeper may block it from running.

This software is completely safe and open source. It does not track you or collect any personal data.

If you see an error preventing the app from opening, follow these steps:

1. Open the "Terminal" app (Cmd+Space, type "Terminal").
2. Copy and paste the following command, then press Enter:

   xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/NetBar.app

3. That's it! You can now launch Net Bar typically to grant it permission.

Enjoy!
